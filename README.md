# ATS Resume Generator
Large companies parsae and sort job applicant resumes using Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). Most applicants will submit word documents or PDFs generated from a word document. Therefore most ATS software will be tuned to parse .docx files. If a resume is generated by other software (e.g. LaTeX), then it may be parsed incorrectly by ATS software and the application rejected.
... Why write your resume in Word when you can write a scipt to do it for you?
