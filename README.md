# ATS Resume Generator
Large companies parsae and sort job applicant resumes using Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). Most applicants will submit word documents or PDFs generated from a word document. Therefore most ATS software will be tuned to parse .docx files. If a resume is generated by other software (e.g. LaTeX), then it may be parsed incorrectly by ATS software and the application rejected.
