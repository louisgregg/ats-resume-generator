# ATS Resume Generator
Large companies parsae and sort job applicant resumes using Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). Most applicants will submit word documents or PDFs generated from a word document. Therefore most ATS software will be tuned to parse .docx files. If a resume is generated by other software (e.g. LaTeX), then it may be parsed incorrectly by ATS software and the application rejected. 
... Why write your resume in Word when you can write a scipt to do it for you? 
## Installation
You can install this script by doing something like:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/louisgregg/ats-resume-generator.git
cd ats-resume-generator
python3 -m venv venv && . venv/bin/activate && pip3 install docx docxtpl
```
You should then have all the requirements (```docx``` and ```docxtpl```) installed. 
## Usage
Run the script with:
```bash
python3 resume_generator.py
``` 
This will generate a document, ```generated_resume.docx```, which should play nicely with the HR departments software. Edit the ```contents``` dictionary in the script to add your own name, work history, etc.
